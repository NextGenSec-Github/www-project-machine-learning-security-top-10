### Type

Suggestions for Improvement

### What would you like to report?

I would like to make the suggestion that we consolidate the terms used in the LLM and ML top 10 documents.

Many of the top 10 items in each are closely related or even the same.
Where possible, the same term should be used (i.e. Model Theft vs Model Stealing, Data Poisoning Attack vs Training data Poisoning).

Thanks!
