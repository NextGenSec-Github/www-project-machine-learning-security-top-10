## Project Timelines

The project is keeping a fortnightly cadence of working group calls to cover
progress of issues and work items.

The first v0.1 release was largely focused on the Github project repository and
the wiki. The wiki is in a state where there is information on the project, its
defined charter, and informaton on how to contribute.

The website is seen as the place that 'consumers' of the Top 10 list will use,
while people looking to contribute will read the wiki (hence being the focus for
v0.1). The current wiki has already had contributions from individuals who have
added content and created pages.

The v0.2 will now focus on the website being at a 'consumable' stage. This is
already being worked on with contributions from individuals.

At this stage the milestones are not time bound.

## Contributions

The project has multiple methods of communication to encourage contributors.
There are currently some issues with the Google Group being publically viewable
outside OWASP which is being worked on (for people who prefer email
communications). There is also Slack and also Github Discussions. Over time the
project expects Github Discussions to be the least friction way questions,
ideas,feedback can be discussed.

Current issues with 'help wanted' have been labelled in Github. The project will
aim to encourage individuals to add their own issues for things they would like
to work on. The issue creation is currently a form with a dropdown for
Questions/Feedback/Enhancement Idea/General in order to streamline the process
(only a Github login is required to log issues).

For those looking at sending a PR (Pull Request) some 'good first issue'
labelled issues have been marked.

Research is being in using 'all-contributors' specification as a way of
recording contributions. This is to encourage all forms of contributions such
as:

- writing blog posts
- discussing the project at a conference
- mentoring
- helping answer questions on Slack/Github

Further info: <https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/overview>

It is the project's aim to ensure there is the least amount of friciton to
contribute, as well as a low barrier to entry for contributions being
reocgnised.

### Help Wanted

- a page outlining the risk calulcation methodology based on the scoring of each
  Top 10 risk
- a page with a 'Glossary of Terms' to help co-ordinate between similar projects
  and efforts and standardise on taxonomy. ref:
  <https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/issues/2#:~:text=I%20did%20a%20first%20scan%20through%20the%20list%20to%20mainly%20look%20at%20taxonomy.%20Here%20are%20my%20remarks>.

#### Project Charter - Call to action

Call to action to gather feedback on the current project charter. 
ref: <https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/discussions/48>

Need more individuals to look at the charter to verify the scope of the Top 10.

e.g. scope is not limited to adversarial attacks and needs to consider
operational hygiene of ML systems.

#### Guidelines for practitioners

At a later stage the project will look at creating guidelines for specific roles
and how they can use the Top 10 in their work.

e.g. what should an application security engineer do next after reading the Top
10 list?
