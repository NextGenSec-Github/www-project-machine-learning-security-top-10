### Type

Suggestions for Improvement

### What would you like to report?

[FEEDBACK]: Model skewing requires altering training data, making it a form of data poisoning. Therefore it is probably better to integrate the two threats.

I agree with you @robvanderveer but then there will be only 9 security risks associated with the OWASP ML page. How do we merge the overlapping contents associated with both the attacks i.e Model Skewing and Data Poisoning?

How about we merge these two attacks and introduce Excessive Agency @robvanderveer as mentioned in https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/issues/89?
