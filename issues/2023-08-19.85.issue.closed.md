### Type

Suggestions for Improvement

### What would you like to report?

I believe 'Packages' to be a too specific term for the problem of supply chain attacks. Calling it 'supply chain attacks' will make the reader aware of the risk that any external component in the AI pipeline can be manipulated. 
Also, add 'data' as a potential supply chain risk, and refer to 'data poisoning' for that, and also add 'model', referring to the transfer learning attack.
