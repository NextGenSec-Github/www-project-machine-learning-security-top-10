### Type

General Feedback

### What would you like to report?

The LLM top 10 mentions excessive agency, because it is important to limit privileges /autonomy / have oversight over LLM's. This is a general AI problem. 
One could argue whether this is a security risk, and I would argue that it is, because just as AI models are unpredictable, they may also have been manipulated. 
I believe the ML top 10 also needs Excessive agency.
